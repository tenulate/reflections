When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    When working from multiple devices a local repo is not practical, as each device 
    would have its own version of the project, and changes made on one device won't be 
    reflected in all the other devices. In this case having a remote repo that all the
    devices can access solves this problem as the latest commits can be pulled from 
    the remote repo before beginning any edits. Once all the changes are made they can
    be pushed back onto the remote repo, allowing all devices access to these updates.
    The same idea holds not just for a single person working off multiple devices, but 
    many people collaborating together.
