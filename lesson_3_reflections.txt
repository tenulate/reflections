When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    When working from multiple devices a local repo is not practical, as each device 
    would have its own version of the project, and changes made on one device won't be 
    reflected in all the other devices. In this case having a remote repo that all the
    devices can access solves this problem as the latest commits can be pulled from 
    the remote repo before beginning any edits. Once all the changes are made they can
    be pushed back onto the remote repo, allowing all devices access to these updates.
    The same idea holds not just for a single person working off multiple devices, but 
    many people collaborating together.
    
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If git was set up to automatically pull from the remote repo then it would disrupt
    your work flow. While in the middle of implementing new functionality to your code
    somebody else could have pushed their latest changes to the repo. These changes 
    may conflict with your current work - which you're not ready to commit yet - and 
    so you'd have to perform a merge. Performing merges is a pretty complex task, it 
    requires you to understand two different pieces of code and decide if they are 
    compatible. It would be disruptive if you had to do this every time somebody else 
    made a commit while you're in the middle of coding your own contribution to the 
    software, and the problem would only get worse as more people contribute to the 
    project.
